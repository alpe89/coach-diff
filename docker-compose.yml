services:
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # PostgreSQL 16
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Main relational database. We use PostgreSQL because:
  # - Open source and free
  # - Excellent JSON support (useful for semi-structured data)
  # - Great integration with Spring Data JPA
  # - Used in production by companies like Instagram, Spotify, Netflix
  #
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    # Alpine is a minimal Linux distro (~5MB vs ~100MB for Debian)
    # Result: smaller and faster image to download

    container_name: coachdiff-postgres
    # Fixed name instead of generated (e.g., coach-diff-postgres-1)
    # Makes commands easier: docker logs coachdiff-postgres

    environment:
      # These variables configure PostgreSQL on first startup.
      # Reads from .env if exists, otherwise uses defaults.
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-coachdiff}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-dev}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-dev}
      # NOTE: In production use complex passwords managed by secrets!

    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
      # Maps container port -> host port
      # So Spring Boot app can connect to localhost:5432

    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      # Named volume: data persists even after `docker compose down`
      # Only lost with `docker compose down -v` (-v flag = volumes)

    healthcheck:
      # Healthcheck allows other services to wait until Postgres is READY
      # (not just started, but accepting connections)
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-dev} -d ${POSTGRES_DB:-coachdiff}"]
      interval: 10s    # Check every 10 seconds
      timeout: 5s      # Timeout for single check
      retries: 5       # After 5 failures = unhealthy
      start_period: 10s # Grace period before starting checks

    networks:
      - coachdiff-network

  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Redis 7
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # In-memory cache. We use Redis because:
  # - Very fast: all operations in memory (~0.1ms)
  # - Supports TTL (Time To Live): data expires automatically
  # - Perfect for caching API responses
  #
  # In our case, we cache:
  # - Profiles: 24h TTL (don't change often)
  # - Match list: 1h TTL (new games)
  # - Match details: 24h TTL (immutable once played)
  # - AI suggestions: 24h TTL (cost money to regenerate)
  #
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: coachdiff-redis

    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
      # Redis can persist data to disk (RDB/AOF)
      # Useful to not lose cache on restart

    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
      # Redis responds "PONG" if healthy
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

    networks:
      - coachdiff-network

# =============================================================================
# Volumes
# =============================================================================
# Named volumes are managed by Docker and persist between restarts.
# Physical location: /var/lib/docker/volumes/ (managed by Docker)
#
volumes:
  postgres_data:
    name: coachdiff-postgres-data
  redis_data:
    name: coachdiff-redis-data

# =============================================================================
# Networks
# =============================================================================
# Custom network to isolate project containers.
# Containers on the same network can communicate using the service name
# as hostname (e.g., postgres:5432 instead of 172.17.0.2:5432)
#
networks:
  coachdiff-network:
    name: coachdiff-network
    driver: bridge
    # Bridge is the default: isolated containers that can communicate with each other
